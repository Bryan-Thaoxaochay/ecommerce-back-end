## What I Learned

### List
1. Creating routes

We had to create routes that involved all the CRUD methods. These helped with managing the database.

2. Creating database models

Tables and data in MySQL were all created from sequelize in JavaScript.

3. Creating associations between models

Associations were used to join tables, so that they appear joined when retrieved.
